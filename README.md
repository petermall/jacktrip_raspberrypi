Config Files to set up JackTrip on Rasperry Pi

We intend to provide a configuration setup to use a Raspberry Pi computer as JackTrip Client/Server.

It requires the jackaudio tools (www.github.com/jackaudio) and JackTrip (www.github.com/jacktrip) to be installed, also a tool that enables to use the Raspberry Pi as WLAN hotspot (e.g. raspap).

Still at very early stage, but running...

The installation of jackaudio and jacktrip as daemon builds on concepts of the Virtual Studio (app.jacktrip.org) setup.
